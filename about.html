                <p>Satori Sake Brewing began with what owner and founder Shin Hasegawa calls his "satori" moment. He'd recently quit his job in tech, moved to the Wood River Valley, and wasn't sure what to do next. One day, while sitting on the chairlift in the clouds, it struck him: he wanted to brew sake and share a part of his Japanese heritage with his new hometown. And with that, the dream of Satori Sake Brewing was born.</p>

                <h3 class="mb-3">What is Satori?</h3>
                <p>In Japanese Buddhism, Satori (sa·toh·ree, 悟り) is the experience of awakening or enlightenment. For us at Satori Sake Brewing, it's the moment we realized what's most important to us: nature, community, and connection. Our sake is a celebration of all three, and we hope that you'll share it with your friends while enjoying Idaho's natural beauty.</p>

                <p>Shin was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan. He trained as a sushi chef in Japan before moving to California to work as a full-time sushi chef in Sacramento and Tahoe. Eventually, he found himself working in tech in the San Francisco Bay Area. However, he kept his passion for cooking, brewing, and fermenting alive, brewing his own beer and making his own miso paste in his spare time. While working in the Bay, he met and fell for a girl from Sun Valley, and followed her to the mountains of Idaho. When he's not brewing sake, Shin can be found skiing, mountain biking, walking his big black lab, and enjoying nature.</p>
