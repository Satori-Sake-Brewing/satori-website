                <h3>A "Satori" Moment</h3>
                <p>Satori Sake Brewing began with what owner and founder Shin Hasegawa calls his "satori" moment. He'd recently quit his job in tech, moved to the Wood River Valley, and wasn't sure what to do next. One day, while sitting on the chairlift in the clouds, it struck him: he wanted to brew sake and share a part of his Japanese heritage with his new hometown. And with that, the dream of Satori Sake Brewing was born.</p>

                <h3>What is Satori?</h3>
                <p>In Japanese Buddhism, Satori (sa·toh·ree, 悟り) is the experience of awakening or enlightenment. For us at Satori Sake Brewing, it's the moment we realized what's most important to us: nature, community, and connection. Our sake is a celebration of all three, and we hope that you'll share it with your friends while enjoying Idaho's natural beauty.</p>

                <h3>About Our Sake</h3>
                <p>Our sake is brewed the same way Japanese sake has been brewed for hundreds of years, using the same four simple ingredients: water, rice, yeast, and koji.</p>

                <h4>Water</h4>
                <p>The clean, pure mountain water of the Big Wood River was one of our original inspirations to brew sake. Good sake is only as good as the water it's brewed with, and we're lucky to be able to draw from the fresh mountain springs that surround our valley.</p>

                <h4>Rice</h4>
                <p>Our rice is from <a href="http://isbellfarms.com">Isbell Farms</a>, a multi-generational family rice farm in central Arkansas. Isbell Farms has a long history of sustainable farming practices and land stewardship, and we're thrilled to be able to use their rice in our sake. We use a Japanese rice varietal milled to 70% to produce our Junmai and Nigori sakes.</p>

                <h4>Yeast</h4>
                <p>Although sake yeast exists, it can be tough to get outside of Japan. For that reason, we use a sparkling white wine yeast used extensively in the production of both red and white wines. We chose this yeast for its neutrality and stable fermentation characteristics.</p>

                <h4>Koji</h4>
                <p>Koji is an essential component of Japanese cuisine. Even if you've never heard of it before, you've probably eaten it! It's a key ingredient in soy sauce, miso paste, and of course, sake. Koji is rice that's been inoculated with <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i>, commonly known as rice mold. We make our koji in-house, turning regular rice into fuzzy, sugar-producing koji.</p>

                <h3>About Shin</h3>
                <p>Shin was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan. He trained as a sushi chef in Japan before moving to California to work as a full-time sushi chef in Sacramento and Tahoe. Eventually, he found himself working in tech in the San Francisco Bay Area. However, he kept his passion for cooking, brewing, and fermenting alive, brewing his own beer and making his own miso paste in his spare time. While working in the Bay, he met and fell for a girl from Sun Valley, and followed her to the mountains of Idaho. When he's not brewing sake, Shin can be found skiing, mountain biking, walking his big black lab, and enjoying nature.</p>
