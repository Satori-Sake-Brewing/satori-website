                                <h5 class="mb-4">14-16% ABV | Namazake | Genshu</h5>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Our Pioneer Nama is a genshu namazake, meaning it's unpasteurized, 100% pure sake with no additives. As our flagship sake, we named it after the Pioneer Mountains that surround Sun Valley and the pioneering spirit of those who are willing to take the path less traveled. This sake embodies the same adventurous and innovative spirit, offering a boldly robust flavor profile and unforgettable taste experience.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5">Since our sake is craft brewed and unpasteurized, you can expect the color to have a more golden hue than commercially produced sake. To ensure an optimal taste experience, we recommend keeping this sake in the refrigerator and consuming it within three months. After three months, the flavor profile will continue to evolve, but the sake itself won't go bad.</p>

Good sake is only as good as the water it's brewed with, and we're lucky to be able to draw from the fresh mountain springs that surround our valley.</p>

Isbell Farms has a long history of sustainable farming practices and land stewardship, and we're thrilled to be able to use their rice in our sake. We use a Japanese rice varietal milled to 70% to produce our Junmai and Nigori sakes.</p>

Our yeast is imported from Japan and is the same strain sake brewers have used for centuries to craft traditional sake.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">Koji is an essential component of Japanese cuisine. Even if you've never heard of it before, you've probably eaten it! It's a key ingredient in soy sauce, miso paste, and of course, sake. Koji is rice that's been inoculated with <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i>, commonly known as rice mold. We make our koji in-house, turning regular rice into fuzzy, sugar-producing koji.</p>
