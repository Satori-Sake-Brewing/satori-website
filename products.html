                                <h6>14-16% ABV | Namazake | Genshu</h6>
                                <p>Our Pioneer Nama is a genshu namazake, meaning it’s unpasteurized, 100% pure sake with no additives. As our flagship sake, we named it after the Pioneer Mountains that surround Sun Valley and the pioneering spirit of those who are willing to take the path less traveled. This sake embodies the same adventurous and innovative spirit, offering a boldly robust flavor profile and unforgettable taste experience.</p>
                                <p>Since our sake is craft brewed and unpasteurized, you can expect the color to have a more golden hue than commercially produced sake. To ensure an optimal taste experience, we recommend keeping this sake in the refrigerator and consuming it within three months. After three months, the flavor profile will continue to evolve, but the sake itself won’t go bad. </p>

                                <h6>14-16% ABV | Namazake | Genshu |Hazy</h6>
                                <p>Like our Pioneer Junmai, our White Clouds Nigori is a junmai genshu namazake, meaning it’s unpasteurized, 100% pure sake with no additives. This nigori-style hazy 
                                    sake evokes softly falling snow on a cold winter’s night, reminiscent of the serene beauty of the snow-capped White Cloud mountains. The delicate, cloudy appearance of this sake is a result of the fine rice particles left suspended in the bottle, creating a velvety smooth texture. With each sip, you'll experience a luxuriously creamy mouthfeel and a subtle sweetness that complements the sake's rich, full-bodied flavor profile.</p>

                                <p>Our sake is brewed the same way Japanese sake has been brewed for hundreds of years, using the same four simple ingredients: water, rice, yeast, and koji.</p>

                                <h4>Water</h4>
                                <p>The clean, pure mountain water of the Big Wood River was one of our original inspirations to brew sake. Good sake is only as good as the water it's brewed with, and we're lucky to be able to draw from the fresh mountain springs that surround our valley.</p>

                                <p>Our rice is from <a href="http://isbellfarms.com">Isbell Farms</a>, a multi-generational family rice farm in central Arkansas. Isbell Farms has a long history of sustainable farming practices and land stewardship, and we're thrilled to be able to use their rice in our sake. We use a Japanese rice varietal milled to 70% to produce our Junmai and Nigori sakes.</p>

                                <p>We carefully select a high-quality yeast strain that is well-suited for crafting premium sake, ensuring a clean and refined flavor profile in each bottle we produce.</p>

                                <p>Koji is an essential component of Japanese cuisine. Even if you've never heard of it before, you've probably eaten it! It's a key ingredient in soy sauce, miso paste, and of course, sake. Koji is rice that's been inoculated with <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i>, commonly known as rice mold. We make our koji in-house, turning regular rice into fuzzy, sugar-producing koji.</p>

                <p>Although sake yeast exists, it can be tough to get outside of Japan. For that reason, we use a sparkling white wine yeast used extensively in the production of both red and white wines. We chose this yeast for its neutrality and stable fermentation characteristics.</p>
