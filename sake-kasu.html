        <h2>What is Sake Kasu?</h2>
        <p>Sake kasu (酒粕, also known as sake lees) is a nutrient-rich byproduct created during the traditional Japanese sake brewing process. It consists of the concentrated solids - fermented rice, koji mold, and dormant yeast cells - that remain after the liquid sake has been carefully pressed and filtered from the mash.</p>
        <p>In Japanese cuisine and culture, sake kasu has been prized for centuries as a versatile ingredient for marinating meats, enriching soups, and pickling vegetables (kasuzuke). Beyond the kitchen, this remarkable fermented product has found its way into luxury skincare formulations and serves as highly nutritious animal feed. Packed with complete proteins, essential amino acids, and a complex of B vitamins (including B1, B2, and B6), sake kasu enhances both nutrition and umami flavor in your culinary adventures.</p>

        <h3>Miso and Sake Kasu Marinade</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Tbsp Miso</li>
            <li>1.5 Tbsp Sake kasu</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Cooking sake</li>
            <li>1 tsp Sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp Mirin</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the sake kasu and the cooking sake together. Adjust the ratio until the mixture resembles soft miso paste. If the sake kasu is too firm to mix, you can brieft microwave it to soften.</li>
            <li>In a plastic ziplock bag, mix together the miso, sake lees mixture from step 1, sugar, and mirin.</li>
            <li>Add the meat or fish of your choice to the bag and massage it well to coat evenly.</li>
            <li>Let sit for at least one hour in the refrigerator. You can marinate it in the fridge for up to two days or freeze it to store for longer.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Amazake (hot, sweet sake kasu drink)—Perfect drink for a cold winter day!</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>200 ml Water</li>
            <li>30 g Sake kasu</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Sugar</li>
            <li>(Optional) Spices like 1 tsp fresh ground ginger or sprinkle of cinnamon</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>If the sake kasu is firm, break it into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Put the water in a small pot and bring to a boil. Once it boils, add the sake kasu, then reduce the heat to low. Stir until the sake kasu soften and dissolve (some rice particles may remain). </li>
            <li>Once the sake kasu has dissolved, increase the heat to high, add sugar and optional spices, then mix until the sugar dissolves.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and pour into mugs.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Salmon Sake Kasu Soup (serves 4)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>100 g Sake kasu</li>
            <li>100 g Salmon (about 1-2 small fillets)</li>
            <li>150 g Daikon radish</li>
            <li>1/4 Carrot</li>
            <li>1/4 Burdock (also known as "gobo") root</li>
            <li>1 block firm or fried tofu</li>
            <li>Green onions for garnish</li>
            <li>2-3 Tbsp Miso (to taste)</li>
            <li>700 ml Water</li>
            <li>5 cm square piece of kombu (dried kelp)</li>
            <li>2 dried Shiitake mushrooms</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preparing the broth</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start by combining 600 ml of water (from the total 700 ml) with the kombu in a pot. In a separate container, mix the remaining 100 ml of water with the washed dried shiitake mushrooms.</li>
                    <li>Let the shiitake mushrooms soak in water for a few hours until softened. Once rehydrated, strain the shiitake soaking water into the pot with the kombu.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cutting the ingredients</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trim and discard the stems of the rehydrated shiitake mushrooms, then cut them into 4–6 pieces.</li>
                    <li>Wash the burdock root, cut it into bite-sized irregular chunks (called "rangiri"), and soak it in water to remove any bitterness.</li>
                    <li>Slice the daikon radish into half-moons about 1 cm thick and the carrot into pieces about 6–7 mm thick. Add all the cut vegetables to the pot with the kombu.</li>
                    <li><strong>Optional Steps:</strong>If using thick green onions, cut into thin diagonal slices, you can also add them to the pot at this stage. Fried tofu (aburaage) will be added later in the process, but you may include it now if preferred.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Start cooking the vegetables</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the pot over medium heat. Once it starts boiling, reduce to low heat. Skim off any scum or foam that surfaces, especially from the shiitake mushrooms.</li>
                    <li>Remove the kombu and simmer the vegetables for 6–7 minutes, allowing them to cook thoroughly.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Prepare additional ingredients</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>While the root vegetables are cooking, cut the fried tofu into thin strips and slice the green onions (thin diagonal slices work well).</li>
                    <li>Cut the salmon, including the skin, into 4–5 bite-sized pieces.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the sake kasu</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sake kasu is hard and prone to clumping if added directly to the soup. To avoid this, place the sake kasu in a bowl and use some broth from the pot to soften and break it up into a smooth paste. Do this near the end of the vegetable cooking time.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Add the protein</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the vegetables are softened, add the salmon pieces and fried tofu to the pot. Simmer over low heat for 3–4 minutes until the salmon is cooked through.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Incorporate the flavorings</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the salmon changes color and is fully cooked, add the softened sake kasu and miso (start with 2–3 tablespoons as a guideline). Use a sieve to dissolve the miso into the broth for a smooth texture.</li>
                    <li>Adjust the seasoning according to the saltiness of the salmon and your taste. It’s better to start with less miso and add more gradually after tasting.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Finish and serve</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the seasoning is adjusted, add the green onions at the end and stir briefly.</li>
                    <li>Your soup is ready to serve!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
